# Tutorials #

These tutorials can be found [here](https://github.com/dipc-cc/hubbard/tree/main/tutorials).

This folder contains three different tutorials with exercises to complete using the `hubbard` package and `sisl`.
The tutorials are in format of `jupyter notebooks`:

[MFH_1](MFH_1/run.ipynb): simulation of Coulomb interactions for electrons in isolated structures (molecules).

[MFH_2](MFH_2/run.ipynb): simulation of Coulomb interactions for electrons in periodic structures

[MFH_3](MFH_3/run.ipynb): simulation of Coulomb interactions for electrons in open-quantum systems.


To open them you can type:
```
jupyter notebook .
 ```
in your terminal which will open a new tab in you navigator with the three directories containing the jupyter notebooks for each tutorial.
