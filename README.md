Welcome to sisl + TBtrans + TranSiesta tutorial
===============================================

This is the tutorial used for sisl + TBtrans + TranSiesta workshops.

The sources used for these tutorials can be found elsewhere:


- [sisl][sisl@git] (>= 0.14.3)
- [TBtrans][tbtrans] (>= 4.1.5)
- [Siesta][tbtrans] (>= 4.1.5)


If you have installed using the installation script you will have access
to MPI parallelized executables.


Binder
------

This tutorial may be runned using [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Note that we highly recommend using a local Conda installation since that is much
more versatile and since this tutorial requires lots of text-editing which is hard
to do in a Jupyter notebook.

However, if you want to play around you may do so, for a good experience you are
recommended to execute tbtrans like this:

    !OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 tbtrans RUN.fdf

since the installed `tbtrans` is threaded and binder is sharing resources.
